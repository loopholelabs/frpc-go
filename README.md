This is the [Go](http://golang.org) implementation of [fRPC](https://frpc.io), a high-performance RPC framework for
designed for performance and stability, and it uses the [frisbee-go](https://github.com/loopholelabs/frisbee-go) messaging framework under the hood.

**This library requires Go1.18 or later.**

## Important note about releases and stability

This repository generally follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). However, **this library is currently in
Alpha** and is still considered experimental. Breaking changes of the library will _not_ trigger a new major release. The
same is true for selected other new features explicitly marked as
**EXPERIMENTAL** in [the changelog](/CHANGELOG.md).

## Usage and Documentation

Usage instructions and documentation for fRPC is available at [https://frpc.io/](https://frpc.io/).

fRPC is still in very early _Alpha_. There may be bugs in the library that will be fixed
as the library matures and usage of fRPC grows. One of the major benefits to fRPC is that reading the generated code
is extremely straight forward, making it easy to debug potential issues down the line.

### Unsupported Features

fRPC currently does not support the following features, though they are actively being worked on:

- `OneOf` Message Types

Example `Proto3` files can be found [here](/examples).
